Database on Economic Integration Agreements (July 2021 Version)
NSF-Kellogg Institute for International Studies
Jeffrey Bergstrand and Scott Baier

This database contains a compilation of all bilateral economic integration agreements between
195 countries from 1950 through 2017. The Excel file contains a Definitions tab, a Country List
tab, a Data Sheet tab, and a Comments & PDF Links tab. The first tab includes the definitions of
each type of agreement and its degree of integration (ranging from 0-6). The second tab
contains a list of the 195 countries included in the database. The third tab is the Excel data sheet
with all compiled information bilaterally of trade agreements between country pairs as exporters
and importers [e.g., Afghanistan (exporter)-Albania (importer) and Albania (exporter)-
Afghanistan (importer) being recognized as two “pairs” in the database]. This data sheet tab
similarly denotes the years when country-pair agreements change in degree of integration and
includes hyperlinks to the PDF file from where that information was obtained. The last tab is the
Comments & PDF Links where the data sheet’s pdf files are hyperlinked and includes additional
information regarding the agreement between the country pair.

It is important to note that, due to the limitations on space in GitHub, we are not able to include
the Excel Data Sheet that includes the “hyperlinks” to the PDF files, nor are we able to include
the PDF files that support the hyperlinks (and hence explain our degree of integration, 0-6). Per
below, one has to download the entire Zip file of the data base, which is available currently at
either of the two links specified below.

This database was created with the purpose of compiling existing information regarding past
and recent trade agreements between countries that recognize not only bilateral and plurilateral
trade agreements, but also non-reciprocal preferential trade agreements (e.g., a country
granting another country GSP status) since the year they were entered into force. This
information helps keep track of how bilateral and plurilateral trade agreements have developed
between countries over time.

The database only recognizes the existing trade agreement of highest degree of economic
integration in a given year for a given pair of countries, not all of its existing trade agreements.
For example, two countries (A and B) may enter into a preferential (but not free) trade
agreement, which is a 2. However, importer A may also have in effect a one-way GSP agreement
with exporter B (which is a 1 for B to A). In this case, the 2 dominates; there are only a few
observations in the database with this overlap.

Trade agreements are included in the database according to the year they enter into force with
the following system. For example, if the agreement entered into force between January 1 and
June 30 of 2015, the year of entry is 2015. If the agreement entered into force between July 1
and December 31 of 2015, the year of entry is 2016. This is employed to account for delays in
implementation of agreements.

The full database can be found in a Zip file at either of two locations. One location is the
